## System Requirements

- Install dependencies according to `./requirements.txt`.
- The finalized executable Jupyter notebook, based on code generated by the AI, can be run on a free-tier Google Colab instance, with a total execution time of under 30 minutes.



## Original Data

The original personality test results on the seven language agents can be found at: https://osf.io/2k458/?view_only=6886694c6f8449488cfbc4e8f78ea2b0, released along with the published paper: [Bodro≈æa, Bojana, et al., 2024](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.240180).
